This project uses [sfml-vscode-boilerplate](https://github.com/andrew-r-king/sfml-vscode-boilerplate) to build.

Instructions for Mac

 * VSCode: `File->Open` and open the `scroller` directory. Then `Cmd-Shift-B`
 * Command line: `./build.sh`. (Fix me: Current script does not copy resources automatically)
